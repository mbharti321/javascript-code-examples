### Version Control

Version control is a system that allows you to manage changes to files or a set of files over time. It enables you to track modifications, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with others efficiently. One popular version control system is Git.

### Git

Git is a distributed version control system that provides powerful tools for managing and tracking changes in files. It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously, seamlessly merging their changes together.

#### Key Concepts in Git

- Repository: A repository, or repo, is a collection of files and their complete history. It holds all the versions of a project, along with metadata such as commit history, branches, and tags.

- Commit: A commit represents a snapshot of the repository at a specific point in time. It contains the changes made to the files and a unique identifier (hash) to track it.

- Branch: A branch is an independent line of development in Git. It allows you to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. Branches can be created, merged, and deleted as needed.

- Merge: Merging combines changes from different branches into a single branch. It integrates the changes made in one branch into another, creating a unified version.

- Pull Request: A pull request is a mechanism for submitting and reviewing code changes. It allows team members to review proposed changes, leave comments, and discuss the modifications before merging them into the main branch.
